# Goal
My goal was to create a remote tutoring website, based on the customer's requirements, where the teachers can add quizzes, assignments, and learning sessions where the students have to login to be able to access it, also the teachers have the ability to allow certain students to access the resources, while others cannot.
Also the quizzes are automatically graded based on the solutions that are entered, and the students could see their mark once the quiz time is finished, also the teachers could grade the assignments and leave comments for students.
Each teacher could have one or more classes to help them organize their students further more.
# Contributions
I started by collecting and breaking down the requirements, splitting it into multiple tasks to be easily managed, then creating the DB schema and the models that'll be used with this schema. I then started implementing these tasks and making sure that each part's working correctly before moving on to the next part.
# Output
The server is now up and running on the following domain: https://remotetutoreg.com/
